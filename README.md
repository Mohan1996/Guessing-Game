# Guessing Game
This is a guessing game created in assembly language. A value has been hard coded, and the user's job is to guess the value stored in the program. If the user guesses too low, the program will output a "Guess higher" message. If the user guesses too high, the program outputs a "too low" message. The program will end when the user guesses the right value.
